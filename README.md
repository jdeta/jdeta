### About Me ☕
- Currently, I work as a Technical Support Engineer at Duo Security.  In my free time, I've been working on a project to learn more about working with SQL databases, a better understanding of object-oriented programming, and design patterns.

- My interests include home theater, mechanical keyboards, homelabbing, fitness, flashlights, and programming.

- After my current project, I'm interested in contributing to open-source projects that help improve accessibility.
