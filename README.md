### About Me ☕
- Currently, I work as a Application Engineer at Duo Security.  I'm currently working on a web application that automatically assigns chores and notifies you via slack.  This app is being developed with a TDD approach.
- My interests include home theater, mechanical keyboards, homelabbing, fitness, flashlights, and programming.

- After my current project, I'm interested in contributing to open-source projects that help improve accessibility.
